    "### **Problem Statement**\n",
    "The **Labor Force Survey (LFS) 2016** dataset provides insights into employment trends in the Philippines. This project aims to analyze labor force participation and employment patterns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to **predict whether an individual was employed in the past week**, based on demographic, educational, and occupational features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Machine Learning Task: Classification**\n",
    "This is a **classification problem**, where the target variable is:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **PUFC11_WORK** (`1` = Worked in the past week, `0` = Did not work in the past week).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Cases and Importance** \n",
    "Understanding employment patterns can help:  \n",
    "- Identify **factors influencing employment status**.  \n",
    "- Recognize **demographic and economic employment trends**.  \n",
    "- Provide **insights for government labor policies** to improve workforce conditions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dataset Source**  \n",
    "The **LFS 2016 dataset** is sourced from the **Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA)** and can be accessed at:  [LFS 2016 Dataset](https://psada.psa.gov.ph/catalog/67/get-microdata) "

    "# **Section 2: Description of the Dataset** \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overview**  \n",
    "The **Labor Force Survey (LFS) 2016** is conducted by the **Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA)** to assess employment and unemployment trends in the Philippines. The dataset includes information about:  \n",
    "- **Demographics** (age, sex, marital status, education).  \n",
    "- **Employment status** (current job, industry type, working hours).  \n",
    "- **Job search activity** (looking for work, method used, weeks unemployed).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Collection Process**  \n",
    "The **LFS 2016** was collected through **household surveys** conducted nationwide. Key details:  \n",
    "- The survey is conducted **quarterly** with a **randomly selected** representative sample.  \n",
    "- Data was collected through **interviews** with household members.  \n",
    "- The **self-reported nature** of responses may introduce biases, especially in informal employment sectors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Implications of Data Collection Method**  \n",
    "- **Underreporting**: Informal or freelance workers may not report their actual working status.  \n",
    "- **Sampling Bias**: Rural and urban areas might have different employment patterns.  \n",
    "- **Response Validity**: Participants may misreport their employment status due to recall errors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Structure of the Dataset**  \n",
    "- **Each row (instance) represents**: A surveyed individual.  \n",
    "- **Each column (feature) represents**: A demographic, employment, or job search characteristic.  \n",
    "- **Number of Instances**: Not explicitly stated in the document but can be determined after loading the dataset.  \n",
